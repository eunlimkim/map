            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> My general hobbies are cooking and drawing. In middle school and high school year, I was not able to go Korean restaurant without my host family 
            and most of the time we ate at home. I decided to cook one for myself and ever since then, it became my hobby! I also love buying new technology products and try it. 
            Especially assistive technology such as google smart speaker or any types of smart home devices makes me so thrilled.
